# liri-node-app
## Description
Liri-app is a node app that allows you to use several APIs to call back information and display it in
                terminal. It is similar to the idea of Siri. Liri will search Spotify songs, OMDB database for movies
                and Bands in Town for concert information. It responds to an input in node for a command such as
                spotify-this-song and will in turn call the API and return information on what was requested
